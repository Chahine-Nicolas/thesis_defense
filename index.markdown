# Abstract
Retrieval in 3D point clouds is a challenging task that consists in retrieving the most similar point clouds to a given query within a reference of 3D points. Current methods focus on comparing descriptors of point clouds in order to identify similar ones, without any particular index structure. Due to the complexity of this latter step, here we focus on the acceleration of the retrieval by adapting the Differentiable Search Index (DSI), a transformer-based approach initially designed for text information retrieval, for 3D point cloud retrieval. Our approach generates 1D identifiers based on the point descriptors, enabling direct retrieval in constant time. To adapt DSI to 3D data, we integrate Vision Transformers to map descriptors to these identifiers while incorporating positional and semantic encoding. The approach is evaluated for place recognition on a public benchmark comparing its retrieval capabilities against state-of-the-art methods, in terms of quality and speed of returned point clouds.
